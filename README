vorg is a simple organizer file format for managing your notes and tasks. It was inspired by org-mode for emacs but the format is different. 
It is still very much work-in-progress. 

Usage:	
create a file with the .vorg extension and insert the following line:		

vim:ft=vorg
		
vorg format:

- Topic Title
  - Sub Topic Title (tag)
    - Sub Sub Topic Title
      sub sub topic text
      [ ] sub sub topic task
		
Notes: 

  ( vorg works best with the vim blackboard theme)

  - To indent sub topics in insert mode, use <TAB>
  - In normal mode, use <TAB> to fold and unfold topics
  - You can also use asterisk signs (*) instead of minus signs(-)
  - Tasks are indicated using a pair of square brackets with a blank inside [ ]
  - You can create tasks without sub items by omitting the -

More Info:

		- Topic with a context @context
		- Topic with a deadline < {date}
		- Topic with a list of tags (tag1,tag2,tag3)
		- Topic with a timestamp | {date} @ {time}
		- Topic with a timestamp | {datetime}
