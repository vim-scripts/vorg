vorg is a simple organizer file format for managing your notes and tasks. It was inspired by org-mode for emacs but the format is different. 
It is still very much work-in-progress. 

Usage: 

Create a file with the .vorg extension and use the following format:

- Topic
  - Subtopic <tag1> <tag2> 
    - Subsubtopic
      Subsubtopic text goes here
    - [ ] A task
    - [ ] Another task
		
Notes: 

  - To indent sub topics in insert mode use <TAB>
  - In normal mode, use <TAB> to fold and unfold topics
  - You can also use asterisk signs (*) instead of minus signs(-)
  - Tasks are indicated using a pair of square brackets with a blank inside [ ]
  - You can create tasks without sub items by omitting the -
